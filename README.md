•	Geographical Hotspots: Certain states, particularly California, have higher churn rates, indicating regional issues that need addressing.
•	Target High Churn Age Groups: Focus retention efforts on the 85+ age group and 70-74 age group, as they exhibit the highest churn rates. Consider specialized offers or support for elderly customers to reduce churn.
•	Optimize Data Plans: Since customers with unlimited data plans and lower usage (0-10 GB) have higher churn rates, consider introducing tiered data plans with benefits aligned to their usage patterns. Educate customers on optimizing their plans based on usage to prevent unnecessary churn.
•	Leverage International Plans: Promote international plans more aggressively, as they are associated with significantly lower churn rates. Highlight the benefits and cost savings of active international plans to customers who travel frequently or have international needs.
